# Hi there 👋

👨‍🎓 - I am Doglas, a student of web development! 🌐

* Currently, I am learning the basics, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

* But I do not want to be a Front End Dev, even though it is an awesome area!

* My objetive is to be a Back End Dev, so, in the future, I am goint to learn Node.js, C# .NET and other tecnologies!

* By the way, I built a game called World War 1.5, an obvious war game. It is very simple, looks like an arcade,
but I loved to develop it!
