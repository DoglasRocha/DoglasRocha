# Hello! 👋

👨‍🎓 - I am Doglas, I am studying Information Systems in UTFPR!

<!--* I know the basics of various languages, like Python, JavaScript, C, Go, C#, but my main goal is to learn about AI.

* But I like BackEnd development a lot!-->

* I built a game called World War 1.5, an obvious war game. It is very simple, looks like an arcade,
but I loved to develop it!
