# Hi there 👋

👨‍🎓 - I am Doglas, a student of web development! 🌐

Currently, I am learning the basics, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

But I do not want to be a Front End Dev, even though it is an awesome area!

My objetive is to be a Back End Dev, so, in the future, I am goint to learn Node.Js, C# .NET and other tecnologies!

But my dream is to be a Game Programmer, work in big a Game Development Enterprises, so, in the future, you are goint to
find some of my adventures in this world! 

By the way, I am build a game called World War 1.5, an obvious war game. It is very simple, looks like an arcade,
but I am loving to develop it!
