# Hi there 👋

👨‍🎓 - I am Doglas, I am studying Information Systems in UTFPR!

* I know the basics of various languages, like Python, JavaScript, C, Go, C#, but my main goal is learnin about AIs.

* But I like BackEnd development a lot!

* By the way, I built a game called World War 1.5, an obvious war game. It is very simple, looks like an arcade,
but I loved to develop it!
